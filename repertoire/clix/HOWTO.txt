To perform any chuck piece that uses networking, set up machine names
as follows.

Mac

Provide a short name with no spaces or weird characters here:

System Preferences > Sharing > Computer Name

Set an environment variable in the shell. This depends what shell is
used and what files configure it. Add the following to .profile or
.bash_profile, as appropriate:

export NET_NAME=thename

where "thename" is the same you entered in the Sharing pane above.

Open a new terminal window and type "echo $NET_NAME" (followed by return).
If it prints your machine name, good.


Windows

There's a way to enter environment variables in a GUI, and these are
available to the DOS shell.
